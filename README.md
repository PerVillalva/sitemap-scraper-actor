## Sitemap Scraper

The Sitemap Scraper is a simple Actor implementation designed to extract and output all URLs from a given sitemap. Provide a sitemap URL as input (e.g., `https://apify.com/sitemap.xml`), and the scraper will retrieve all listed URLs along with additional metadata, such as the last modified dates.

## Example Output

```json
{
    "url": "https://www.apify.com/",
    "lastMod": "2025-03-17"
}
```
